The algorithm to figure out what part of social security benefits are taxable.

The IRS's worksheet (see Pub. 915) is lengthy, and I've found that textbook explanations for how to compute this are 
often quite confusing. However, I believe the complexity in the IRS' worksheet is caused by optimization.

The simple, elegant, and short algorithm I came up with below is conceptually the same as the IRS's worksheet, 
but without the optimizations and with extra effort given to conceptual clarity.

I've made the conscious decision NOT to optimize this loop at all.  I felt the process had become so optimized on the
IRS's worksheet that it made the process conceptually confusing.  Conceptual confusion can lead to overly complex
code, which can lead to unexpected bugs and difficulty debugging.

That being said, removing the 0% part of the loop would not increase the complexity of the code unduly and should be 
considered if using this for non-conceptual purposes.
