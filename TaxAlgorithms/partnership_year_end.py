    The first two steps are self-explanatory and taken from IRC ยง706 and CFR ยง 1.706-1.

    The last step (Least Aggregate Deferral) is more interesting:
    The key to doing this is to realize that the process of finding the partnership year end is a dot product.
    What's more, it's actually taking a 2D matrix of inputs and multiplying it by a 1D array of weights.
